I'll analyze your gamified habit tracker app specification and create a comprehensive system design with Node.js and Supabase. Let me break this down into a structured system design and development plan.I've created a comprehensive system design and development plan for your gamified habit tracker app. Here are the key highlights:

## System Architecture Overview

The design follows a **modular monolith** architecture with Node.js/Express and Supabase, providing:
- **Clean separation** of concerns with dedicated services
- **Event-driven** real-time updates via Supabase
- **Scalable database** schema supporting all game mechanics
- **RESTful APIs** with proper authentication and authorization

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Database Schema**: Comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with 15+ tables covering all app features including users, skills, tasks, enemies, achievements, and economy systems.

2. **Service Layer**: Modular services (UserService, GameEngineService, etc.) handling specific business logic with clear interfaces.

3. **Real-time Features**: Leveraging Supabase's real-time subscriptions for live XP updates, achievement notifications, and game state changes.

4. **Integration Ready**: Built-in support for health apps, push notifications (FCM), and payment processing (Stripe).

## Development Flow & Module Connections

The system follows this data flow pattern:
- **User Actions** → **API Endpoints** → **Service Layer** → **Database** → **Real-time Updates** → **Client**

For example, when a user completes a task:
1. TaskService validates and processes completion
2. GameEngineService calculates XP rewards and distributes to task/skills/user
3. Achievement system checks for unlocks
4. Real-time updates notify the client immediately
5. Notifications are scheduled for future reminders

## 18-Week Development Plan

The plan is structured in 5 phases:
1. **Foundation** (Weeks 1-3): Setup, database, authentication
2. **Core Mechanics** (Weeks 4-7): Skills, tasks, basic game engine
3. **Advanced Features** (Weeks 8-11): Enemies, economy, achievements
4. **Enhanced Features** (Weeks 12-15): Analytics, notifications, real-time
5. **Polish** (Weeks 16-18): Optimization, security, compliance

This design ensures your app will be scalable, maintainable, and ready for the complex gamification features you've specified. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific module or create detailed implementation code for particular components?
